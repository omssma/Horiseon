The semantic elements enforces a better use of the webpage. They will make it easier for future editing and improvements, since they are easy to distinguish. The elements are also put in logocal order, regarless of their position on the page.

Images are also displayed. If they don't load, however, they will be altered with texts that tells the user where they are.

The heading is put in orderly list, so it is sequential and undertood.

The title element is also unique, as it will display "Welcome to Horiseon."
