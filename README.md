![screencapture-omssma-github-io-Horiseon-2021-08-29-21_27_50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89227607/131273556-285db72b-39ad-4e0b-81fe-af9e50fd3063.png)

The semantic elements provide for streamlined browsing. They will allow for future editing and improvements since they are easy to distinguish. The elements are put in a logical order, regardless of their position on the page.

Images are displayed. If they fail to load, however, they will be altered with text that tells the user where they are.

The heading is put in an orderly list, so it is sequential and easily understood.

The title element is unique, as it will display "Welcome"
